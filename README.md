Warehouse Mangement System
Problem statement: Develop a web-based application that enables a digitalization for a warehouse to manage their product inventory efficiently. 

The application should include the following features:
Inventory management: The application should allow the warehouse to add, view, and update their inventory products. The warehouse should be able to search for product based on keywords and tags.

Inbound management: The application should allow the warehouse to track the incoming products, record the supplier information, and update the inventory accordingly.

Outbound management: The application should allow the warehouse to track the outgoing products, record the customer information, and update the inventory accordingly.

User management: The application should allow the warehouse to create and manage user accounts with different levels of access and permissions. For example, a warehouse manager should have access to all features, while operator should only have access to the outbound and inbound workflow.
